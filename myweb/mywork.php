                <div class="workpara">The Beauty Parlour Management System is a web-based application that aims to streamline the operations of a beauty parlour. The system has two main user roles: admin and user. The admin can manage the appointments, users, and enquiries through the dashboard, where they can also change their password and log out. The admin can view and accept or reject new appointments, update selected appointments, and view and delete appointments. Additionally, the admin can view the users list and users' inquiries and delete them if necessary. On the other hand, users can view the beauty parlour's information, services, and gallery without signing in. Users can sign up to register an account, book an appointment, and access the user dashboard. The user dashboard has buttons for edit their details, view and delete their booked appointments, change their password, book new appointments, log out, and delete their profiles. Overall, the Beauty Parlour Management System streamlines the process of managing appointments, users, and inquiries for a beauty parlour while providing easy and convenient access to users. </div>
